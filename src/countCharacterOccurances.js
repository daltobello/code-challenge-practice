/**
 Develop a function that accepts a single string as its argument. The function should analyze the input string and produce an output in the form of an object. This object should contain key-value pairs where each key is a unique character from the input string, and the corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that character within the string. 
 
 Ensure your function accounts for all characters in the input, including whitespace and special characters.
