/*
Write a function that takes a number n as input and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1. For example, the sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.

Your function should adhere to the following requirements:

It should take a single parameter n, which represents the position of the number in the Fibonacci sequence (starting from 0).
It should return the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.

GOAL: return the value of the Fibonacci sequence at position n (the number that is input into the function)
INPUT: number
OUTPUT: number
