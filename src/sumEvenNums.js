function sumEvenNums() {

}

export default sumEvenNums

/*
Objective:
Write a function sumEvenNums that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list.

Requirements:

The function should iterate through the list and add up all the even numbers.
If the list contains no even numbers, the function should return 0.
If the list is empty, the function should also return 0.
Example Inputs & Outputs:

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: 12 (because 2 + 4 + 6 = 12)

Input: [17, 23, 81]
Output: 0 (because there are no even numbers)

Input: []
Output: 0 (because the list is empty)
